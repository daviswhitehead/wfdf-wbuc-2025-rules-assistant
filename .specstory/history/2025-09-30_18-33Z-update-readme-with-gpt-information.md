# Update README with GPT information (2025-09-30 18:33Z)

_**User (2025-09-30 17:21Z)**_

Please update the README with any information you think would be relevant to someone who's trying to use this GPT. Be sure to include a link to the GPT itself. I've included that below.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating README.md**

I need to update the README.md file, and it's just a simple one-file edit. I might consider creating a to-do, but since it’s straightforward, I could skip that step. However, the developer tool requires status updates when I use tools. First, I'll read the current content of README.md using the functions.read_file to ensure I don’t overwrite anything important. I'll also reference gpt/instructions.md for additional guidelines while reviewing both files to streamline the process. Let’s get started!</details></think>

---

I'll open the existing `README.md` and `gpt/instructions.md` to understand current content and add a usage section with the provided GPT link, preserving the file's formatting.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating README.md**

I need to update the README.md with usage information and include the provided GPT link. My preferred method is to use apply_patch, which should keep the original formatting intact. I want to keep things concise while adding sections like quick start, usage tips, citation style, and contributing instructions. 

I’ll ensure to format everything in markdown, using descriptive anchor text for the link to the GPT. The goal is to provide clear guidance while preserving the document’s structure.
**Following update protocols**

I need to keep up with the tools' cadence by providing a status update and managing the task list. Since this is a small edit, I can skip creating a todo per the specifications. The developer instructions suggest using todos for more complex tasks, but it's just a single edit here. I'll first provide the status update before applying the patch. 

After checking the content lines, I'll insert a "Getting Started" section after line 2, ensuring proper markdown formatting with headings.
**Updating sections in the file**

I see that the file currently has sections like "# wfdf-wbuc2025-rules," "# Resources," and "## Links." My plan is to add a new section, "# Use the GPT," right after the introduction. This maintains the structure with two top-level headings. 

I'll also propose concise bullets for "How to ask" and "Answer format" to align with the instructions. Plus, I'll include a direct link with appropriate markdown. Finally, I'll apply the patch to make these updates.</details></think>

I’m going to add a concise “Use the GPT” section near the top of `README.md` with a direct link to the GPT and brief usage instructions, preserving the current markdown style.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Running README checks**

I edited the README, and now I need to provide a status update. Since this is straightforward, I won’t create any todos. Should I run read_lints on the README to check for issues? The tool reads linter errors, though this repo might not have a lints config. I’ll call read_lints with the README path and provide a brief summary, including a link to GPT. I’ll be cautious not to include excessive formatting, but I can summarize with bullets. Let's go ahead and run read_lints.</details></think>

---

I added a “Use the GPT” section with the direct link, usage guidance, expected answer format, and example prompts to README. I’ll quickly check for any linter or formatting issues in the updated file.

---

Tool use: **read_lints**

---

- Added a new “Use the GPT” section to `README.md` with:
  - Direct link to the GPT.
  - How to use guidance.
  - Expected answer format.
  - Example prompts.
- Verified there are no linter issues in `README.md`.
