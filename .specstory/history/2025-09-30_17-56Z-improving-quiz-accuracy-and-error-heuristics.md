# Improving quiz accuracy and error heuristics (2025-09-30 17:56Z)

_**User (2025-09-30 17:21Z)**_

See below for a summary of where this GBT is failing, and please make updates to its instructions with this feedback in mind.

Thanks for sharing both the **instructions** and the **quiz results**. This gives us a clear picture of where the breakdown happened. You got **23/30** correct, which means **7 wrong**. Let‚Äôs retro each one, figure out *why* my answers missed, and how to improve the system for future quizzes.

## ‚ùå Wrong Questions Analysis

### **Q6 ‚Äì Straddle definition (18.1.1.2)**

* **Your Answer:** TRUE
* **Correct Answer:** FALSE
* **Why wrong:** I relied on older memory of the straddle definition. WFDF updated 18.1.1.2 in 2021 ‚Äî the definition is no longer simply ‚Äúline between defender‚Äôs feet contains pivot.‚Äù
* **Fix for GPT:**

  * Always double-check **rule text in 2025‚Äì28 docs** before answering (don‚Äôt rely on memory of 2021).
  * Emphasize in heuristics: ‚ÄúBeware definition updates since 2021 (esp. straddle, minor contact, possession).‚Äù

---

### **Q12 ‚Äì Call retraction (15.11)**

* **Your Answer:** TRUE
* **Correct Answer:** FALSE
* **Why wrong:** I confused WFDF‚Äôs encouragement to retract bad calls (Spirit 1.5.1) with Rule 15.11. The actual rule states that a call can only be retracted *before the outcome is determined*, but not for tactical reasons (‚Äúno longer benefits your team‚Äù). The quiz phrasing tricked me.
* **Fix for GPT:**

  * Differentiate *Spirit guidance* from *rules text*.
  * Use rule references strictly: 15.11 is narrower than general Spirit examples.

---

### **Q13 ‚Äì Airborne catch + throw before landing = possession**

* **Your Answer:** FALSE
* **Correct Answer:** TRUE
* **Why wrong:** I over-applied the ‚Äúmust maintain control through ground contact‚Äù clause. That applies to **catching**, but once possession is established (sustained control, more than an instant), the player *is the thrower* even if still airborne. The 2021 update clarified this.
* **Fix for GPT:**

  * Update possession heuristic:

    * Possession = control + noticeable instant.
    * Ground contact only matters for establishing in-/out-of-bounds, not for defining possession itself.

---

### **Q19 ‚Äì Indirect foul call timing (17.8.1.1)**

* **Your Answer:** TRUE
* **Correct Answer:** FALSE
* **Why wrong:** Misread the rule requirement. 17.8.1.1 allows ‚Äúindirect fouls‚Äù to be called *later* if not immediately recognized. They are not required ‚Äúas soon as‚Äù like direct fouls.
* **Fix for GPT:**

  * Add explicit heuristic: direct fouls = immediate, indirect fouls = flexible timing.
  * Flag ‚Äúmust‚Äù language in quiz as a red flag ‚Äî check rule wording carefully.

---

### **Q20 ‚Äì Offence walking disc can change to running (8.5)**

* **Your Answer:** FALSE
* **Correct Answer:** TRUE
* **Why wrong:** I interpreted ‚Äúmust be carried without delay‚Äù as ‚Äúmust walk.‚Äù But 8.5 doesn‚Äôt prohibit running ‚Äî players may carry at any pace as long as not delayed or advanced improperly.
* **Fix for GPT:**

  * Don‚Äôt assume ‚Äúwalk‚Äù means literally walking. Clarify language: rule requires *without delay*, not *walking pace*.

---

### **Q23 ‚Äì Double team, throw hits defender, incomplete ‚Üí disc back to thrower (18.1.5)**

* **Your Answer:** TRUE
* **Correct Answer:** FALSE
* **Why wrong:** Misapplied continuation. Even if double-team existed, unless the throw was demonstrably affected, result stands. In this case, hitting defender = turnover, not automatic nullification.
* **Fix for GPT:**

  * Heuristic: Only nullify if *call affects play*. If ambiguous, default to ‚Äúoutcome stands.‚Äù
  * Pay attention to 16.2/16.3 continuation exceptions.

---

### **Q25 ‚Äì Rolling disc stopped, position altered, must move back immediately (8.4.1)**

* **Your Answer:** TRUE
* **Correct Answer:** FALSE
* **Why wrong:** I overstated. WFDF 8.4.1: disc should only be moved back *if requested by opposition*. I treated it as automatic requirement.
* **Fix for GPT:**

  * New heuristic: ‚ÄúRolling disc relocation = only if requested.‚Äù
  * Be cautious of absolutist quiz wording like ‚Äúmust always.‚Äù

---

## üìå Systemic Improvements

1. **Cross-check tricky definitions.** Always verify definitions (straddle, catch, possession, minor contact) against 2025 rules, not older versions.
2. **Differentiate Spirit vs Rules.** Quiz writers exploit this. Rules like 15.11 are stricter than Spirit examples.
3. **Handle continuation carefully.** WFDF continuation (16.2/16.3) has many exceptions. Default to ‚Äúoutcome stands‚Äù unless explicitly nullified.
4. **Beware absolute quiz wording (‚Äúmust,‚Äù ‚Äúalways,‚Äù ‚Äúno exceptions‚Äù).** Often false unless explicitly codified.
5. **Use ‚Äúif requested‚Äù clauses.** Many WFDF mechanics (e.g., moving disc, adjusting pivot) only apply if opposition calls it.
6. **Re-learn updated possession logic.** Possession = control + instant. Ground contact matters only for in-/out-of-bounds, not for establishing possession.
7. **Revise heuristics for ‚Äúwalking the disc.‚Äù** Rule requires ‚Äúwithout delay,‚Äù not literal walking pace.

---

‚úÖ **Summary:**
You missed 7 questions due to over-reliance on old rule memory (Q6, Q13, Q27), confusing Spirit vs Rules (Q12), or misinterpreting mechanics/absolutes (Q19, Q20, Q23, Q25).
Future GPT answers should:

* Prioritize *exact 2025 rule text*,
* Watch for Spirit-vs-rule traps,
* Avoid absolute interpretations unless explicitly stated,
* Default to continuation standing unless clearly nullified.

Do you want me to **rewrite the ‚Äúerror reduction heuristics‚Äù section** of your GPT instructions with these fixes baked in, so future quizzes are less error-prone?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning file updates**

I need to update the instructions file with some heuristics. This seems like a medium task since it's a single file edit but with multiple points to cover. I‚Äôm thinking of using a todo list for this. First, I‚Äôll plan to update the error-reduction heuristics in the gpt/instructions.md file. Then, I want to add references to the 2025 docs and any relevant rule cross-check guidance, plus maybe a quiz answering procedure. Let‚Äôs go ahead and read the file first.</details></think>

---

I'll open the current `gpt/instructions.md` to see the existing heuristics section, then update it with the concrete fixes you listed so the model uses 2025 rule text, differentiates Spirit vs Rules, and tightens continuation and possession logic.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating instructions**

I need to update instructions.md with new heuristics, which will be a medium edit. Since this involves multiple changes, I should use a to-do list per spec, even though it's one file. I might skip them for simpler tasks, but the developer tool spec encourages using them for multi-step edits. I'll make a brief to-do with reviewing heuristics and updating sections. I want to keep indentation and formatting consistent, especially with hyphen lists, and consider how to incorporate user fixes into ‚ÄúError reduction heuristics.‚Äù
**Implementing heuristics updates**

I‚Äôm adding various heuristic bullets, like cross-checking 2025 text, differentiation, possession heuristic, and including caution regarding "must" wording. I‚Äôll also consider clauses like "if requested," and clarify walking disc language, direct vs. indirect foul timing, and straddle definitions. Retracted specifics from 15.11 need to be included too, but I want to keep everything concise. I might create a "Rules parsing tactics" subsection but could expand the "Error reduction heuristics" section instead. I‚Äôll skip reading the README and proceed with writing the to-do, then edit the file using apply_patch. After that, I‚Äôll run read_lints, but it's markdown, so maybe lints aren‚Äôt necessary. Let‚Äôs implement!</details></think>

---

I'll add a short todo to track updating the heuristics, then update `gpt/instructions.md` to incorporate the specific fixes: prioritize 2025 rule text, distinguish Spirit vs Rules, refine possession and continuation logic, caution on absolute wording and "if requested" clauses, clarify direct vs indirect foul timing, and correct interpretations around straddle, call retraction, walking the disc, double-team continuation, and rolling disc relocation.

I reviewed the heuristics and implemented your fixes directly in `gpt/instructions.md`. The Error reduction heuristics now emphasize using WFDF 2025‚Äì2028 text, separating Spirit guidance from rules, refined possession and continuation logic, caution on absolute phrasing and ‚Äúif requested‚Äù clauses, correct direct vs indirect foul timing, and clarifications on straddle, retractions, walking the disc, double-team continuation, and rolling disc relocation.

- Completed: updated `Error reduction heuristics` with targeted bullets reflecting Q6, Q12, Q13, Q19, Q20, Q23, Q25 learnings; no linter issues detected.
- Next: if you want, I can add a short ‚ÄúCommon traps‚Äù mini-section or embed quick examples for each heuristic.

- Edits made in `gpt/instructions.md` strengthen:
  - 2025 rule text priority and update-awareness (straddle/possession).
  - Spirit vs Rules differentiation, especially 15.11.
  - Possession definition vs ground contact; airborne thrower handling.
  - Continuation default-to-stand unless demonstrably affected (16.2/16.3).
  - Language traps: must/always/no exceptions; ‚Äúif requested‚Äù clauses (8.4.1).
  - Transport after turnover (8.5) permits running; focus on ‚Äúwithout delay.‚Äù
  - Direct vs indirect foul timing (17.8.1.1).

Please update the guidance in @instructions.md to HEAVILY HEAVILY HEAVILY prioritize the information in this particular knowledge doc: WFDF-Rules-of-Ultimate-2025-2028-BEACH.pdf

I‚Äôm going to update `gpt/instructions.md` to explicitly and repeatedly prioritize the `WFDF-Rules-of-Ultimate-2025-2028-BEACH.pdf` as the single primary source, adjust citation guidance to cite it first with sections/pages, and add heuristics stating it overrides other sources unless an appendix explicitly supersedes it.

Tool use: **read_lints**

I updated `gpt/instructions.md` to heavily prioritize the primary knowledge doc `WFDF-Rules-of-Ultimate-2025-2028-BEACH.pdf`:

- Authority and sources now explicitly name that PDF as the single authoritative source, with clear conflict policy and deference rules.
- Answer format and citations instruct citing that PDF first, with section and page references.
- Comparison policy reiterates WFDF priority over USAU.
- Error reduction heuristics now start with ‚Äúdefault to the primary PDF‚Äù and clarify how Appendices are used only when they explicitly supersede.
- Implementation note instructs treating that PDF as canonical and using other docs only to supplement when the primary defers.

Want me to add a short citation template snippet to speed answers, e.g., ‚Äú¬ßX.Y (p.Z)‚Äù?
