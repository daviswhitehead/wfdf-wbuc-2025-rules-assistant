Add these links to the Resources section in readme with a brief description:
- @https://rules.wfdf.sport/ 
- @https://wfdf.sport/event/wfdf-2025-world-beach-ultimate-championships-wbuc/ 
- @https://rules.wfdf.sport/accreditation/ 
- @https://wfdf.sport/spirit-of-the-game/

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Editing README.md**

I need to edit the README.md file to add links under the Resources section with brief descriptions. This is a straightforward single-file edit, so I’m thinking it might be okay to skip using a todo list. I’ll provide a status update before the tool calls, and then I’ll apply the patch to modify the file. I need to ensure the new bullet list maintains proper indentation. Including a minimal summary with the links seems wise, even if the citation isn’t strictly necessary.
**Adding bullets to Resources**

I need to add bullet points under the Resources section to make sure everything is clear and organized. It's important to keep this correct and properly formatted. Once I have the bullet list ready, I'll apply the patch to update the README.md file. I’m focusing on ensuring the information is concise and accessible for anyone reviewing the document later. Let's get this done efficiently!</details></think>

I'll add the requested resource links with brief descriptions to the `README.md` under the `# Resources` section.

Nest these under a Links subsection, then add a section for wfdf docs where you name and describe each file in the wfdf directory

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Editing README.md**

I need to edit the README.md to create a "Links" subsection under Resources and include links. I also want to add a section for WFDF documents, where I’ll name and describe each file in the WFDF directory. I’m wondering if I should use todos for this, but since it's a small task, I think I’ll skip that. I should read the current content of the README.md file to make sure I modify it correctly.</details></think>

---

I'll update `README.md`: create a "Links" subsection under `# Resources` and move the added links there, then add a "WFDF Docs" section listing and briefly describing each file in the `wfdf` directory.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Editing README.md**

I need to make some changes to the README.md file. I’ll nest links under a new "Links" subsection and create a "WFDF Docs" section to describe each file in the wfdf directory. This includes listing five PDFs with brief descriptions while keeping everything properly indented.

For example, I can describe the first PDF as a concise reference guide for key Ultimate rules and common situations in 2019. I’ll also describe the hand signals guide as a visual reference for calls. Let's get this organized!
**Updating WFDF Docs**

Alright, I have an outline for the WFDF documents I need to describe. I’ll list these three PDFs with their respective titles and brief descriptions. The first is the full Beach Ultimate rules for 2025-2028, the second is an appendix for details specific to beach events, and the third is a comparison between WFDF and USAU rules.

I’ll maintain bullet formatting and create a "Links" subsection under Resources. Since this is a minor update, I won't add to the to-do list, but I should check for lint errors in the README after editing. Let's apply that patch!</details></think>

---

I'll reorganize the Resources section by adding a "Links" subsection and moving the existing links under it, then add a "WFDF Docs" section that lists and briefly describes each PDF in the `wfdf` directory.

---

Tool use: **apply_patch**

---

Updated `README.md`:
- Created `## Links` under `# Resources` and moved the existing links there.
- Added `## WFDF Docs` listing and briefly describing each file in the `wfdf` directory.

Let me know if you want different descriptions or ordering.

Next, add a section in the Resources section called "USAU Docs". Name each doc and give it a brief description for each doc in usau directory

---

I'll check whether a `usau` directory exists and, if present, enumerate its files to document them. If it's missing, I'll add an empty "USAU Docs" section noting no files found and ask you to add the docs.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating USAU Docs Section**

I need to add a section for USAU Docs under Resources, including a list of files in the usau directory and brief descriptions. I'll edit the README.md, following proper indentation and placing the section after WFDF Docs. I'll keep descriptions concise. It's important to provide status updates when using tools, like noting that we've made one tool call (list_dir). I'll also remember to apply the patch to README.md, adding "## USAU Docs" along with the bullet list of files and their descriptions.
**Finalizing Resource Descriptions**

It seems I need to enhance the resource descriptions. The overview should cover the USA Ultimate Beach Ultimate program. For the resources, I have specific files to mention, like the Official Rules for the 2024-2025 cycle and the USAU Rules Policy effective since 2018. I also have the memo on the receiver becoming a thrower. It's essential to preserve spaces with proper indentation - just bullet points starting with “-”. I’ll apply the patch, but I don't think citations are necessary this time. A summary should wrap it up nicely.</details></think>
