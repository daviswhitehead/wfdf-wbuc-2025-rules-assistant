# Developing a custom GPT for WBUC 2025 (2025-09-30 16:36Z)

_**User (2025-09-30 15:58Z)**_

Next, I'd like your help taking this codebase of documents and creating a custom GPT around it. The goal of the custom GPT is to help answer any questions someone would have about with diffs WBUC 2025 each ultimate rules.

There are two primary use cases for this custom GPT, and these use cases apply to myself and my teammates. Use case number one is answering various questions about WBUC 2025 beach ultimate rules. It might be something like: "If a disc pull rolls out of bounds out of the back of the end zone, where does the offense put the disc into play? At the back line or at the goal line?" Use case number two is to help pass the WFDF Beach Ultimate Rules Accreditation quiz. This may involve copying and pasting various scenarios or questions about rules and helping the user choose the correct answer, alongside citations of rules backing that up.

Another more personal use case is: For me as a Spirit Captain of the team, to understand the rules super well, especially as it relates to Spirit of the Game, so that we can put our best foot forward at the competition.

For reference, my team is competing in the Open Masters division at the WFDF 2025 World Beach Ultimate Championships in Portimão, Portugal on November 16th.

Assume you're an expert in custom GPT development and you have an excellent product mindset. Given my description of the use cases and goals of this assistant above, please help me develop a custom GPT that achieves my goals and more. Are there any questions that would be useful to ask now in pursuit of developing this custom GPT?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Proposing retrieval structure**

I’m thinking about proposing structured metadata, like rule numbers and sections, while also defining retrieval chunk sizes and rerankers. After composing this, I want to include a brief summary at the end that follows the summary specifications since there are no code changes. For a basic query, if the user asks for information, I should summarize the answer at the end. I’ll wrap this all up with a short summary of the questions and next steps. Let’s deliver!</details></think>

---

### Clarifying questions to shape the custom GPT

- **Primary authority and scope**
  - Should the GPT treat WFDF 2025 Beach rules and appendices as the single source of truth, or also incorporate USAU materials for comparisons?
  - Do you want the model to answer strictly per WFDF 2025 Beach rules, or optionally provide “differences from USAU” on demand?

- **Citations and granularity**
  - What citation format do you prefer (e.g., “Rule 7.8.1”, “Appendix A 3.2”, page number, and quotation)?
  - Do you require verbatim quotes in answers or just references with paraphrases by default?
  - Should the model refuse to answer without a precise rule citation?

- **Use modes**
  - Separate modes or one assistant? For example:
    - “Ask a rule” mode (natural Q&A with citations)
    - “Quiz” mode (multi-choice with elimination rationale and rule citations)
    - “Spirit Captain” mode (SOTG guidance, dispute de-escalation, language templates)
  - Should the GPT proactively ask clarifying questions (e.g., number of players, wind, timeouts) before answering?

- **Quiz support**
  - Will you paste screenshots/text from the WFDF accreditation quiz? Do you need extraction/OCR?
  - Should the assistant provide the best choice only, or also rank choices with rule-backed rationale?
  - Any constraints about not revealing answers unless asked (to encourage learning)?

- **Comparisons and diffs**
  - Do you want automatic “WFDF vs USAU” differences included in every answer, or only when requested?
  - How should the GPT handle conflicts (e.g., flag differences and prioritize WFDF unless user changes mode)?

- **Content ingestion**
  - Are all PDFs final and authoritative, or should we track versions and effective dates?
  - Is OCR needed, or do the PDFs have selectable text? Any non-English content?
  - Do you want a structured knowledge layer (extracted rule ids, headings, definitions, examples) for better retrieval?

- **Answer style and tone**
  - Target tone: concise and authoritative, or explanatory and educational?
  - Include quick TL;DR first, then expandable detail?
  - Include field mechanics and hand signals when relevant?

- **SOTG/Spirit Captain features**
  - Should the assistant generate pre-game SOTG briefings, post-game feedback summaries, and incident logs?
  - Do you want conflict-resolution scripts, language for respectful calls, and “teach back” prompts?

- **Team and access**
  - Who needs access (entire team or leadership only)? Single shared GPT or multiple variants?
  - Authentication or sharing constraints? Do you want usage analytics and content feedback?

- **Safety and policy**
  - Should the assistant avoid giving legal/medical advice; any other red lines?
  - Should it avoid guessing when rules are ambiguous and ask for clarification?

- **Tech and deployment**
  - Preferred platform: OpenAI “GPTs”, Assistants API, or a standalone app (e.g., Vercel + vector DB)?
  - Any constraints on hosting (data residency, privacy)? Is cloud storage of embeddings acceptable?
  - Budget for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) components like rerankers and eval runs?

- **Evaluation and quality**
  - Do you want a small test set of rule scenarios for regression testing?
  - What accuracy bar is acceptable for quiz mode? Should we log mistakes and iterate?

- **Interaction add-ons**
  - Need tools like a calculator, timezone/date awareness, or a “rule navigator” that jumps to specific sections?
  - Should we enable browsing for future rule updates (2026+)?

### Fast next steps I can take once you confirm preferences
- Define the system prompt and modes (Rule Q&A, Quiz, Spirit) with citation policy.
- Extract and index your PDFs with chunking tuned for rule sections and appendices; add a reranker.
- Build a quiz helper that accepts pasted questions and returns choice ranking with rule cites.
- Add SOTG templates: pre/post-game checklists, incident logs, respectful call phrasing.

Give me answers to the questions above (even partial), and I’ll scaffold the custom GPT promptly. 

- Provided a focused question set to define scope, modes, citations, ingestion, and deployment.
- Outlined immediate build steps pending your preferences.

_**User (2025-09-30 15:58Z)**_

Another core goal of this custom GBT assistant is to help my teammates and myself understand the differences between WFDF beach rules and USA rules, since we all play USA ultimate by default.

To answer your questions:
The gpt should prioritize with diff 2025 beach rules but also provide comparisons to usau materials as it's useful no preference on citation format verbatim quotes not required references are good enough the model shouldn't refuse to answer it should potentially search the web in case of uncertainty and let the user know that it's searching the web instead of relying on a known citation and then it should also provide the user with a confidence level in its response such as low medium or high no need for separate modes no need to ask clarifying questions proactively unless they're very important to providing a better answer for the quiz screenshots and text may be pasted it's fine to reveal answers. Automatic with the first USAU differences is generally preferred. The gpt should always prioritize with diff WBUC beach rules. Authoritative OCR is not needed. I don't think we need a structured knowledge layer. Concise, authoritative, and explanatory is great, including a summary first and then details beyond is fine but generally keeping answers and responses succinct is important. Definitely including field mechanics and hand signals when relevant is nice. No need to go deep on this spirit captain features right now. The entire team will access this as a single shared GPT. Authentication is not important right now, nor is analytics or feedback. No need to give legal or medical advice. It should never guess but as I mentioned before it's fine to search the web and provide some answer grounded in either in-depth internal or external sources which should be cited when the answer is really unknown. Just say that there's low confidence in that you don't know. I'm gonna use OpenAI's GPTs for this. No need to worry about hosting or cloud storage or embeddings. No need worry about RAG. Small set of test rule scenarios sounds good. No need to log mistakes and iterate for quiz mode. In fact, no quiz mode is required, just a single mode. No need for interaction add-ons.

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Building custom GPT definition**

I’m focused on developing a custom GPT definition, especially since we’ll be using OpenAI’s GPT builder. I’ll outline key steps: creating a system prompt, defining knowledge inclusion, and establishing response styles, among others. I also need to draft test questions and potentially update a README. Since this is a multi-step process, I’ll create a series of tasks, like drafting prompts and providing usage guides, while organizing everything into the appropriate `gpt/` directory. Time to track tasks efficiently!
**Creating files and todos**

I need to apply a patch to create files and remember that I should always include status updates when using tools. My next steps involve creating todos and implementing files. In the prompt, I'll make sure to address priorities like the WFDF 2025 Beach rules, including USAU differences, and adding citations with rule ID/page where possible. I’ll also mention hand signals, provide concise TL;DR summaries, set confidence levels, and specify the retrieval order for internal PDFs first. Safety disclaimers will be included too!
**Crafting answer templates**

I’m thinking of designing an "Answer template" using a JSON-like structure but in natural language. This template will include a TL;DR section, the answer itself, WFDF citations, USAU differences, mechanics and signals, confidence levels, and sources. Additionally, I want to create 10-15 test scenarios that include correct answers and citations. I’ll make sure everything is clear and easy to implement, while also being informative for users who might be using this template in the future.</details></think>

---

I'll start by drafting a full GPT configuration (prompt, answer template, behavioral rules) and companion files (usage guide and test scenarios). Then I’ll create those files in a new `gpt/` folder in your workspace.

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [-] Create GPT system prompt aligning with WFDF-first, USAU diffs, citations, confidence
- [ ] Add answer template and response policies (TL;DR, citations, confidence, mechanics)
- [ ] Write usage/setup guide for OpenAI GPTs with your PDFs
- [ ] Create test scenarios with answers and citations for quick validation
- [ ] Add quick reference: list of files to upload and naming guidance

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning file creation**

I need to create several files in a gpt/ directory, including system_prompt.md, answer_template.md, usage.md, test_scenarios.md, and files.md. I’ll be using apply_patch to add these files, and I should keep the user updated with concise status updates before and after my tool calls. After the files are created, I might run a lint check, but markdown files might not need it. 

I'll ensure that the content meets specific requirements, like aligning with WFDF first and making it succinct while including relevant details.</details></think>

I created a full GPT scaffolding and documents, then marked each task complete.

- I’ll pause briefly to confirm nothing else is needed right now. If you’re good, you can paste `gpt/system_prompt.md` into OpenAI’s GPT builder, upload the listed PDFs, and you’re live.

- Files added in `gpt/`:
  - `system_prompt.md` — WFDF-first rules, auto USAU diffs, citations, confidence, web fallback.
  - `answer_template.md` — TL;DR, details, WFDF vs USAU, citations, confidence.
  - `usage_guide.md` — step-by-step for creating the GPT in OpenAI GPTs with recommended settings.
  - `test_scenarios.md` — 10 sanity-check scenarios to validate behavior.
  - `files_to_upload.md` — authoritative list of PDFs to upload.

- Quick next step: want me to import a couple of your scenarios from `test_scenarios.md` and draft exemplar answers with citations to verify tone and structure?

_**User (2025-09-30 15:58Z)**_

Here's the name of the custom gpt:
WFDF WBUC 2025 Rules Assistant

next I need a description and Instructions. instructions should be less than 8,000 characters. where can i find those? if they don't already exist, can you document them please.

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning documentation creation**

I need to provide both a description and instructions based on the user’s request. We’ve already made the system_prompt.md for instructions, which is likely under 8k characters, so that’s manageable. I’ll propose a concise text for the description. Once that's ready, I can copy the details into a new gpt/instructions.md and a short description in gpt/description.txt. After creating these files, I’ll update the to-do list and ensure everything is marked as complete.
**Creating rules assistant documentation**

I need to develop documentation for the WFDF WBUC 2025 Rules Assistant, which helps athletes quickly address questions about the WFDF 2025–2028 Beach Ultimate rules, including key differences from USAU. I plan to incorporate scenario input, provide a quick summary, rationale, contrasts, field mechanics, hand signals, and confidence ratings. I’ll reuse the content from system_prompt.md but tailor it into a single block for the GPT builder in a new file called gpt/instructions.md. Let’s keep the headings minimal as we produce this.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Creating files and instructions**

I need to create both description and instructions files. It looks like I've already started on the todos. I think I'll create files in the gpt/ directory named description.txt and instructions.md. I’ll use the apply_patch method to add these files. It’s important to provide concise status updates before making any tool calls. Lastly, I need to review the todos and summarize everything when we’re done. Let's get started!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Resolving patch errors**

I encountered an error while trying to apply a patch twice. It seems like I might need to create a directory file, but the path exists. The error indicates that it failed to find context, which is strange. Maybe I have to ensure the path with spaces is exact since I used an absolute path before. I'll try again with simpler lines for the patch content. I also need to create an instructions file and update my todos. Let's go ahead and use multi_tool_use.parallel to run two patch adds simultaneously.</details></think>

Ok, we have the following resources for the public custom gpt creation:
- @name.md 
- @description.md 
- @instructions.md 

We're missing:
- Logo
- Conversation Starters
- Knowledge
- Recommended Model
- Capabilities

For each item we're missing, can you create a doc that addresses it? Or leave a placeholder doc.

_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Organizing documentation needs**

I’m focusing on creating documentation for several missing items under gpt/. First, I need to prepare files for the logo, conversation starters, knowledge references, recommended models, and capabilities. For that, I’ll create several markdown files, ensuring each one has the right guidelines and content. I also need to update the todo list and ensure that status updates are managed carefully before making any tool calls. Let’s get started on this!</details></think>
