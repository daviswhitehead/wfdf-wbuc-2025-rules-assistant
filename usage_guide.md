Usage tips
- Ask naturally. Example: “The pull rolls out the back of the end zone; where is the pivot?”
- For scenarios, include the key facts (e.g., contact, touched in-bounds, wind, timeout status) when relevant.
- If a citation looks generic, ask “Can you cite the exact rule numbers?”
- To emphasize differences, ask “Include USAU differences.” (It’s on by default.)

Maintenance
- If documents update, re-upload and tell the GPT “Use the latest version.”
- For ambiguous rulings, accept Low confidence with external citations, or ask the GPT to search.
